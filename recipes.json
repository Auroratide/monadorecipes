Salmon, tilapia, and even carrots are common ingredients in tempura, lining up with the Steel Salmon, Windyfish, and Meaty Carrot in the original recipe.</p><p>We opted for a pre-made tempura batter mix for simplicity, though it is simple enough to create your own batter from raw ingredients. Lastly, adding a little seasoning to the batter adds a slightly unique flavor profile to the tempura, characterized by the Angel's Sage in the original recipe. While rice and the dipping soy sauce are not implied in Aegaeon's recipe, we felt it would round out the plate for a full meal.</p>","references":["https://www.justonecookbook.com/tempura-recipe/"]},{"id":"white-hot-eggy-curry","name":"White-Hot Eggy Curry","unlisted":false,"type":"staple","source":"Crossette's Cooking","rarity":2,"timeInMinutes":80,"image":{"sources":{"webp":[{"src":"/_app/immutable/assets/main.BBKsCWIt.webp","w":600},{"src":"/_app/immutable/assets/main.BJV3sdzt.webp","w":1600}],"png":[{"src":"/_app/immutable/assets/main.CeAsljDB.png","w":600},{"src":"/_app/immutable/assets/main.C_wPiQvJ.png","w":1600}]},"fallback":{"src":"/_app/immutable/assets/main.C_wPiQvJ.png","w":1600,"h":900},"alt":"White-Hot Eggy Curry"},"description":"A very spicy Japanese-style curry that uses eggs and mushrooms in place of meat.","ingredients":[{"name":"Rice","type":"Grain","rarity":1},{"name":"Potatos","type":"Vegetable","rarity":1,"preparation":"cubed","measure":{"amount":{"numerator":3,"denominator":1},"unit":"quantity"}},{"name":"Carrot ","type":"Vegetable","rarity":1,"preparation":"cubed","measure":{"amount":{"numerator":4,"denominator":1},"unit":"quantity"}},{"name":"Onion","type":"Vegetable","rarity":1,"preparation":"chopped","measure":{"amount":{"numerator":1,"denominator":1},"unit":"quantity"}},{"name":"Portobello Mushrooms","type":"Vegetable","rarity":2,"preparation":"sliced","measure":{"amount":{"numerator":8,"denominator":1},"unit":"ounces"}},{"name":"Eggs","type":"Meat","rarity":1,"measure":{"amount":{"numerator":6,"denominator":1},"unit":"quantity"}},{"name":"Ketchup","type":"Vegetable","rarity":1,"measure":{"amount":{"numerator":2,"denominator":1},"unit":"tablespoons"}},{"name":"Golden Curry Mix","type":"Spice","rarity":3,"preparation":"hot","measure":{"amount":{"decimal":3.2},"unit":"ounces"}},{"name":"Cayenne","type":"Spice","rarity":2},{"name":"Salt","type":"Spice","rarity":1}],"directions":{"steps":["One to two sentences.","One to two sentences.","One to two sentences."]},"gameIngredients":{"Acid Tomato":2,"Death Mushroom":1,"Meaty Carrot":1,"Gromrice":1,"Glitterspud":2},"interpretation":"<p>A couple of paragraphs on why we chose to make the recipe the way we did based on the above ingredients.</p>","references":["Link to reference","Link to reference"]},{"id":"wingberry-cake","name":"Wingberry Cake","unlisted":false,"type":"dessert","source":"Jin's Home Cooking","rarity":3,"timeInMinutes":90,"image":{"sources":{"webp":[{"src":"/_app/immutable/assets/main.BI_Sz_aN.webp","w":600},{"src":"/_app/immutable/assets/main.DeB74_Bu.webp","w":1600}],"png":[{"src":"/_app/immutable/assets/main.CpOMZrio.png","w":600},{"src":"/_app/immutable/assets/main.D-Islb0p.png","w":1600}]},"fallback":{"src":"/_app/immutable/assets/main.D-Islb0p.png","w":1600,"h":900},"alt":"Wingberry Cake"},"description":"A cranberry and almond upside-down coffee cake made with honey instead of vanilla.","ingredients":[{"name":"Brown Sugar","type":"Spice","rarity":2,"measure":{"amount":{"numerator":2,"denominator":3},"unit":"cups"}},{"name":"Butter","type":"Oil","rarity":1,"measure":{"amount":{"numerator":1,"denominator":3},"unit":"cups"}},{"name":"Cranberries","type":"Fruit","rarity":3,"measure":{"amount":{"numerator":5,"denominator":4},"unit":"cups"}},{"name":"Almonds","type":"Nut","rarity":1,"preparation":"chopped","measure":{"amount":{"numerator":1,"denominator":2},"unit":"cups"}},{"name":"Butter","type":"Oil","rarity":1,"measure":{"amount":{"numerator":1,"denominator":2},"unit":"cups"}},{"name":"White Sugar","type":"Spice","rarity":1,"measure":{"amount":{"numerator":3,"denominator":4},"unit":"cups"}},{"name":"Eggs","type":"Meat","rarity":1,"measure":{"amount":{"numerator":2,"denominator":1},"unit":"quantity"}},{"name":"Honey","type":"Spice","rarity":1,"measure":{"amount":{"numerator":3,"denominator":1},"unit":"teaspoons"}},{"name":"Sour Cream","type":"Dairy","rarity":2,"measure":{"amount":{"numerator":1,"denominator":1},"unit":"cups"}},{"name":"Flour","type":"Spice","rarity":1,"measure":{"amount":{"numerator":3,"denominator":2},"unit":"cups"}},{"name":"Baking Powder","type":"Spice","rarity":1,"measure":{"amount":{"numerator":3,"denominator":2},"unit":"teaspoons"}},{"name":"Baking Soda","type":"Spice","rarity":1,"measure":{"amount":{"numerator":1,"denominator":1},"unit":"teaspoons"}},{"name":"Nutmeg","type":"Spice","rarity":3,"measure":{"amount":{"numerator":1,"denominator":2},"unit":"teaspoons"}},{"name":"Salt","type":"Spice","rarity":1,"measure":{"amount":{"numerator":1,"denominator":4},"unit":"teaspoons"}}],"directions":{"steps":["Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
