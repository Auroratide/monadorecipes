<Page title="About Monado Recipes">
	<BasicPanel>
		<p>Monado Recipes is a fan-made repository of recipes based on food found in the <a href="https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Xenoblade_Wiki">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> games.</p>
		<p>Really, it's one big creative culinary exercise: how do you take fantasy ingredients like "Mookah Flour" and create a "Pan-Fried Tartari"? What even is a tartari anyway?</p>
		<p>We reimagine the game's recipes as real things you can cook. If you're a fan of the games or are perhaps just looking to serve something a little different, then try one of our Monado Recipes!</p>
