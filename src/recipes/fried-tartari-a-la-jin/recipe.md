## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425°F (215°C). Cut carrots and potatoes into large slices, around ½ - ¾ inches thick. [Carrots: 3, Potatoes: 3]
2. Place sliced carrots and potatoes into a large bowl. Combine with honey and italian seasoning and toss until evenly coated. On a large baking tray, evenly distribute carrots and potatoes and cover with foil. Bake for 30 minutes, tossing halfway through. Proceed with steps 3-10 while roasting. When done, remove from oven and place somewhere to cool. [Honey: 1 tablespoon, Italian Seasoning: 2 teaspoons]
3. Place breadcrumbs in a new bowl. Grate ½ an onion into the bowl so the juices and pulp mix with the breadcrumbs. Evenly coat breadcrumbs and let sit for a couple minutes. [Breadcrumbs: 1/3 cup, Onion: 1/2]
4. Add ground beef, ground turkey, 1 clove minced garlic, egg, ketchup, beef bouillon, 1/2 tsp. worchestershire sauce, and 2 tsp. dijon mustard to the bowl. Preferrably using your hands with a food-safe glove, mix the ingredients in the bowl for a few minutes until homogenous and soft. Divide into five patties and set aside. [Ground Turkey: 1/2 pound, Ground Beef: 1/2 pound, Garlic: 1 clove, Egg: 1, Ketchup: 2 teaspoons, Beef Bouillon: 1 tablespoon, Worshestershire Sauce: 1/2 teaspoon, Dijon Mustard: 2 teaspoons]
5. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat. Gently add the patties and sear for around 1 minute on each side. Be careful when flipping, as they are still soft. If your skillet isn't large enough to cook all five patties with space in between each, cook three at a time. Remove to a plate when done searing. [Vegetable Oil: 1 tablespoon]
6. Lower heat to medium high. Add ½ finely chopped onion and 2 cloves minced garlic to the skillet and cook until onions are translucent, about 3 minutes. Add in sliced mushrooms, lightly salt, and cook for an additional 2 minutes or until golden brown. [Onion: 1/2, Garlic: 2 cloves, Mushrooms: 6 ounces]
7. Turn down skillet heat to medium. Add butter, then when melted, add flour and cook for around 30 seconds, stirring constantly. Try to add flour in top of other ingredients and not directly onto the bare skillet. [Butter: 2 tablespoons, Flour: 1/4 cup]
8. Slowly add in beef broth, stirring constantly to remove clumps. Once all beef broth is added and stirred in, add water, remaining worchestershire sauce, and 1 tsp dijon mustard. Add salt and pepper to taste. [Beef broth: 2 cups, Water: 1/2 cup, Worshestershire Sauce: 2 teaspoons, Dijon mustard: 1 teaspoon]
9. Add in patties to the gravy and cook for 6 minutes on each side. Occasionally stir the gravy in the skillet and add water if the gravy starts to get too thick. 
10. Serve patties with the gravy, optionally on top of a bed of rice, and with honey-roasted vegetables on the side!

## Interpretation

* Buloofo Beastmeat: 2
* Rhogul Birdmeat: 2
* Weeping Flour: 1
* Nest Extract: 1
* Barbed Tomato: 2

This is one of the few recipes in Xenoblade 2 for which we have a visual reference. In the Great Tornan Cook-Off, Jin can cook either the Fried Tartari or the Wingberry Cake, and either will show the final result of the recipe. That's the primary reason we chose a salisbury steak to represent the tartari: ground meat fried to perfection and dowsed in gravy.

The meat is a mixture of beef (beastmeat), poultry (birdmeat), and ketchup (barbed tomato), pan-fried as the recipe name suggests. The flour thickens the roux that eventually becomes the gravy atop the steak, giving it that classic salisbury look and taste.

Finally, we generally interpret Nest Extract to be honey, since they are collected from the nests of Alrest's bee-like creatures. Honey does not blend naturally with a mushroom-based gravy, so since the reference image includes some side vegetables, we used the honey to roast carrots and potatoes on the side.
