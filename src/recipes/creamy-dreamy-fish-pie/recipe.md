## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C), and prepare a 9x9 baking dish.
2. Prepare the Instant Mashed Potatoes by following its instructions. Mix the walnuts into the mashed potatoes, and season with black pepper. [Instant Mashed Potatoes: 4 oz, Walnuts (chopped): 1/2 cups]
3. Melt the butter in a medium-sized pan over medium heat. Mix the flour into it and stir until the mixture becomes a golden brown. [Butter: 3 tablespoons, Flour: 1/4 cups]
4. Pour the milk into the pan and bring to a simmer on medium-high heat. [Milk: 2 cups]
5. Add the lime juice, lime zest, and salt into the sauce. [Lime: 1]
6. Once it starts bubbling, add the fish and grape-halves into the sauce. Reduce the heat to medium-low and let simmer for about 10 minutes. [Haddock: 2, Red Grapes (halved): 1 cup]
7. Pour the sauce into the 9x9 baking dish. Spread the mashed potatoes over the sauce, completely covering it.
8. Bake the mixture for 20-25 minutes, or until the top has browned.
9. Let stand for about 5 minutes before serving. To match Manana's style, decorate with some edible flowers!

## Interpretation

* Fatty Serprond Fillet: 3
* Rainbow Boronia: 2
* Babybubble Berry: 3
* Neo Walnut: 2
* Squeezy Lime: 2

Fish pies do not normally contain grapes, but Manana's version does! Grapes are among the most bubbly berries we have, and they actually work quite well in fishy dishes; some Icelandic stews combine grapes with wolffish to create a unique blend of flavors.

Wolffish is not commonly available everywhere, so we use haddock fillets in this recipe to represent the Serpond. The walnuts add structure to the crust, and the lime adds more to the fruity flavor.

Finally, the boronia is a flower, as depicted in the Creamy Dreamy Fish Pie's official image.
