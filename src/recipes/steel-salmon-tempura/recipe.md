## Ingredients

| Ingredient           | Quantity       | Rarity | Type      |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------ | --------- |
| Salmon               | 1 fillet       | 2      | Fish      |
| Tilapia              | 1 fillet       | 2      | Fish      |
| Carrots              | 2              | 1      | Vegetable |
| Tempura Batter Mix   | 1 cup          | 2      | Grain     |
| Italian Seasoning    | 2 teaspoons    | 1      | Spice     |
| Vegetable Oil        | 3 cups         | 1      | Oil       |
| Cold Water           | 3/4 cup        | 1      | Liquid    |
| Rice (optional)      | 2 cups         | 1      | Grain     |
| Soy Sauce            | 2 tablespoons  | 1      | Liquid    |
| Lime Juice (optional) | 1 teaspoon    | 1      | Liquid    |


## Directions

1. Refrigerate water while preparing other ingredients. The water must be ice cold before use in the tempura batter. [Water: 3/4 cups]
2. Heat the oil in a fryer or pot, aiming for approximately 330°F (165°C). [Vegetable Oil: 3 cups]
3. Slice the fish into thin pieces, about 1.5 &times; 1.5 inches in dimension and about ⅓ inches thick. The size does not need to be precise, so long as the pieces are thin enough to cook through in a short fry time. [Salmon: 1 fillet, Tilapia: 1 fillet]
4. Slice the carrots into thin, chip-like pieces. These should be very thin, almost ⅛ inches in thickness. [Carrots: 2]
5. Combine tempura batter mix with italian seasoning. Briefly mix the tempura batter and cold water. Do not thoroughly mix - small clumps in the batter are better for the tempura crust. [Tempura Batter: 1 cup, Italian Seasoning: 2 teaspoons, Water: 3/4 cups]
6. Once the oil is ready, dip pieces of fish/carrot into the batter until completely covered, then carefully lower into the oil. Fry pieces for about 2 minutes. Do not overcrowd the oil with pieces.
7. After about 2 minutes, remove pieces onto a rack with paper towels underneath. Repeat step 6 until all the fish and carrots are fried.
8. Prepare the soy sauce, optionally mixing in lime juice, for dipping. Serve with rice. [Soy Sauce: 2 tablespoons, Lime Juice: 1 teaspoon, Rice: 2 cups]

## Interpretation

* Steel Salmon: 2
* Windyfish: 2
* Meaty Carrot: 1
* Ruska Flour: 1
* Angel's Sage: 1

Tempura is a classic Japanese-style dish, characterized by its flaky battered crust. Thus, we decided on the simple but effective route for Aegaeon's dish - a fish and carrot tempura, with rice and soy sauce for flavor. Salmon, tilapia, and even carrots are common ingredients in tempura, lining up with the Steel Salmon, Windyfish, and Meaty Carrot in the original recipe.

We opted for a pre-made tempura batter mix for simplicity, though it is simple enough to create your own batter from raw ingredients. Lastly, adding a little seasoning to the batter adds a slightly unique flavor profile to the tempura, characterized by the Angel's Sage in the original recipe. While rice and the dipping soy sauce are not implied in Aegaeon's recipe, we felt it would round out the plate for a full meal.
