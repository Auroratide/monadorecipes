7. Cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then invert onto a serving plate. Enjoy!

## Interpretation

* Cranberry Bell: 2
* Ruska Flour: 2
* Weeping Flour: 2
* Melosian Honey: 1
* Lactonut: 1

Jin's Wingberry Cake is, as its name implies, a cake that gets its flavor from berries and its crunch from nuts. Due to the large amounts of flour in the recipe, we interpret this as a kind of upside-down coffee cake.

Cranberry Bells imply that cranberries are the fruit of choice. As for the nut, we chose almonds since almonds sometimes used as a milk alternative; in other words, a "Lactonut" is a milky nut.

Finally, many coffee cake recipes ask for either vanilla extract or cinnamon. For this recipe, we substitute those with honey since Jin's recipe calls for Melosian Honey.
