## Directions

1. Begin cooking the rice.
2. Cut the squash, carrots, and bell peppers into thin slices. Thinner slices will cook more quickly and allow you to sear them on higher heat. [Squash (sliced): 2 cups, Carrots (sliced): 1 cup, Red Bell Peppers (sliced): 1]
3. Heat the oil in a wok or large pan on medium-high heat. Cook the onions until translucent, about 5 minutes. [Onions (diced): 1 cup]
4. Toss the squash and carrots into the pan and sauté for about 5 minutes. [Squash (sliced): 2 cups, Carrots (sliced): 1 cup]
5. Toss the bell peppers and corn into the pan and sauté for another 3 minutes. Add salt as desired. [Red Bell Peppers (sliced): 1, Corn: 12 oz]
6. Remove from the heat and immediately pour the General Tso sauce onto the vegetables. Mix so that all the vegetables are coated. [General Tso Sauce: 3 tablespoons]
7. Serve with rice!

## Interpretation

* Sumpkin: 1
* Meaty Carrot: 1
* Barbed Tomato: 2
* Creeping Starpepper: 2
* Hustle Hyacinth: 1

Named for its swift sauté method, this dish focuses on vibrant orange and yellow veggies, sidelining greens for a fiery 'magma' color. We favor acorn squash as Sumpkins for its texture and availability, hefty carrots as Meaty Carrots to emulate meatiness, and bell peppers as Starpeppers for their vaguely star-like shape and compatibility with stir-fry dishes.

For the Barbed Tomato, we are using General Tso's sauce since it contains tomato paste. For the final ingredient, Hustle Hyacinth, we tried corn since the hyacinth is also used in a salsa, a dessert pie, and considered a "vegetable" item in Xenoblade 2. Although atypical in sautés, it adds both a bubbly texture to the "magma" and a unique flavor to the dish.
