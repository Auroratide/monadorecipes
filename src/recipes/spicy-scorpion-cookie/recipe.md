| Baking Soda          | 1/2 teaspoon   | 1      | Grain     |
| Salt                 | 1/4 teaspoon   | 1      | Spice     |

| Chia Seeds           | 3 tablespoons  | 3      | Nut       |

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C), and prepare a cookie sheet pan. For reference, this recipe will make about 24 small cookies.
2. Beat the butter, brown sugar, white sugar, and egg together in a large bowl. After beating it for a bit, add the tomato paste. [Butter (soft): 1/2 cup, Brown Sugar: 3/8 cup, White Sugar: 1/4 cup, Egg: 1, Tomato Paste: 2 teaspoons]
3. Combine the flour, baking soda, cayenne pepper, and salt in another bowl. Gradually stir the mixture into the butter mixture. Note, these cookies are pretty spicy, so feel free to use less cayenne pepper than recommmended here. [Flour: 1 1/4 cup, Baking Soda: 1/2 teaspoon, Cayenne Pepper: 1 teaspoon, Salt: 1/4 teaspoon]
4. Fold in the macadamia nuts and chia seeds. [Macadamia Nuts: 1/2 cup, Chia Seeds: 3 tablespoons]
5. Scoop a spoonful of dough for each cookie onto the pan, separated 1 to 2 inches apart.
6. Bake in the oven for about 10 minutes, and enjoy! Or, try to enjoy. It's a Mythra special after all...

## Interpretation

* Creeping Starpepper: 1
* Lactonut: 1
* Barbed Tomato: 2
* Gregarious Scorpion: 1

Cookies are not supposed to be spicy, nor contain scorpion, but here we are! Since the recipe contains Lactonuts, we based Mythra's experiment on macadamia nut cookies.

For the spice, we use cayenne pepper, which is a ground form of red pepper. For the barbed tomato, we used tomato paste, giving the cookie a nice reddish hue. We tried other forms of tomato, but due to their water content would always make the cookies overly cakey.

As for the scorpion? You can't generally buy scorpions or bugs, so instead we simulate it with chia seeds! The seeds act like flakes of the scorpions' exoskeletons, giving the cookies a unique look and... unsettling crunch.
