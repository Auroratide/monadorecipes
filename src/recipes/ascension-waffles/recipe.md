## Directions

1. Dissolve salt and brown sugar in 8 cups water in a large pot. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat and allow to cool. Add vinegar, black pepper, allspice, and garlic powder. [Salt: 1/2 cups, Brown Sugar: 2 tablespoons, Water: 8 cups, Vinegar: 1/4 cups, Black Pepper: 1 teaspoon, Allspice: 1 teaspoon, Garlic Powder: 1 teaspoon]
2. Cut chicken into waffle-sized pieces. Add chicken, submerging completely. Brine for 1.5-2 hours in a refrigerator. Complete steps 3-6 while chicken is brining. [Chicken: 2 pounds]
3. While chicken is brining, add mango, granulated sugar, red pepper flakes, and 3/4 cups water to a saucepan. Stir together and bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. [Mango (chopped): 1 1/2 cups, Sugar: 1 cup, Red Pepper Flakes: 1 teaspoon, Water: 3/4 cups]
4. Remove from heat and allow to cool 3 minutes. Press the mango mixture into a fine mesh, separating syrup from the mango. Add syrup back to the saucepan, reduce again for 5 minutes. Let syrup cool completely.
5. In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups pancake/waffle mix, egg, and 1 cup cold water. Mix ingredients just enough to homogenize. [Pancake Mix: 2 cups, Water: 1 cup]
6. Cut bell pepper into small slices. These will primarily serve as garnish and/or a fresh snap to the savory dish. [Bell Pepper: 1]
7. After brining, rinse chicken completely with water. In a large pan, add vegetable oil until the pan has about 1/2 inch oil in it. Heat on medium high.
8. Add chicken to the waffle batter mix, covering each side with batter. Once oil is heated, add chicken to the hot oil and fry for 4-5 minutes on each side. Do not overcrowd the pan.
9. After frying both sides, remove chicken to a breathable rack with paper towels underneath.
10. Serve with bell peppers and mango syrup and enjoy!

* Do not spice the batter. Try mango pulp instead of mango pieces. Might try adding self-rising flour to waffle batter mix. Is there a way to fry the chicken without overfrying the batter?
