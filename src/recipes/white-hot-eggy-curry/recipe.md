| Boiled Quail Eggs (15 oz) | 1 can     | 2      | Meat      |
| Tomato Paste         | 2 tablespoons  | 1      | Vegetable |
| Golden Curry Mix (hot) | 3.2 ounces   | 3      | Spice     |
| Oil                  | 2 tablespoons  | 1      | Oil       |
| Salt                 | -              | 1      | Spice     |
| Rice                 | -              | 1      | Grain     |

## Directions

1. Start cooking the rice in your favorite rice cooker.
2. Heat two tablespoons of oil into a medium sized pot on medium-high heat. Stir the onions, carrots, potatoes, and tomato paste in the oil for about 5 minutes. Season with salt if desired.
3. Pour 2Â¾ cups of water into the pot and add the sliced mushrooms. Let boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.
4. Add the Golden Curry Mix and the can of boiled quail eggs (strained of water). Allow to simmer uncovered for another 5 minutes, stirring constantly so the curry mix dissolves.
5. Serve over rice and enjoy!

## Interpretation

* Acid Tomato: 2
* Death Mushroom: 1
* Meaty Carrot: 1
* Gromrice: 1
* Glitterspud: 2

Since Crossette's character design is heavily Japanese-inspired, we interpretted her curry as a variation on Kare Raisu, Japanese curry over rice.

The ingredients list mostly matches, too: Gromrice (rice), Glitterspud (potatoes), and Meaty Carrots (carrots) are all common ingredients in Kare Raisu. Though the Japanese version typically includes meat, Crossette's recipe omits it, so we used Death Mushrooms and eggs as substitutes, with eggs fitting the "eggy" curry name.

Finally, it's easiest to use a prepackaged Roux, for example from Golden Curry. Find the hottest variant you can if you want to match Crossette's "white-hot" recipe!
