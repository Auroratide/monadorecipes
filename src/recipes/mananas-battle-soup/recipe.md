## Directions

1. Ideally, have the shredded rotisserie chicken prepped before cooking. You can purchase a cooked chicken at a store and manaully shred the chicken breasts for the required 2 cups. You can freeze the remaining chicken for future recipes. [Rotisserie Chicken: 2 cups]
2. Finely dice the spring onions, bell pepper, garlic cloves, and one of the carrots. [Spring Onion (chopped): 1 cup, Green Bell Pepper: 1, Garlic: 2 cloves, Carrot (minced): 1]
3. Cut the potatoes and remaining carrot into small ½ to 1-inch chunks. Cut the radishes into quarters. Set aside. (Optional) Cut the potatoes into ½ inch slices instead, and cut star shapes out of them to match the in-game representation of the dish. [Russet Potato: 3, Radishes (quartered): 1 1/2 cups]
4. Melt the butter in a large pot. Stir in the spring onions, bell pepper, garlic, and diced carrot and cook for about 2 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt. [Butter: 1/3 cup, Spring Onion (chopped): 1 cup, Green Bell Pepper: 1, Garlic: 2 cloves, Carrot (minced): 1]
5. Stir flour into the pan and cook until flour gives a slightly toasted smell. Be careful not to burn the flour. You may need to stir in the 1 cup of optional water if it is too thick. Final consistency should be between a sauce and a paste. [Flour: 1/2 cup]
6. Pour 1 cup vegetable stock into the mixture and bring to a simmer for about 5 minutes. [Vegetable Stock: 1 cup]
7. Pour the remaining 3 cups of vegetable stock, the potatoes, radishes, shredded chicken, and chopped carrot into the pot. Stir until combined and simmer for 5 minutes. Lightly season with salt and pepper. [Vegetable Stock: 3 cups, Potatoes (sliced): 3, Radishes (quartered): 1 1/2 cups, Rotisserie Chicken (shredded): 2 cups, Carrots (chopped): 3]
8. Stir in heavy cream and smoked paprika. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15-20 minutes. Stir occasionally. Add salt and pepper to taste. [Heavy Cream: 2 cups, Paprika: 2 teaspoons]

## Interpretation

* Glitter Radish: 2
* Comet Carrot: 2
* Bunnit Meat: 1

Manana's Battle Soup is one of the first recipes players gain access to, and it appears to be a creamy chowder-style soup in-game. This aligns with the ingredients list somewhat - chowders commonly include an array of vegetables and a protein. Though radishes are not a common ingredient in chowders, we felt they would pair well with potatoes and carrots in this recipe.

For the Bunnit Meat, we opted for chicken. Bunnits appear like rabbits in the game, and rabbit meat has been likened to chicken meat. All together, the Glitter Radish and Comet Carrots make up parts of the chowder, and we chose potatoes to be the vegetable that appears like stars in the soup itself. This dish comes out to be a creamy and hearty delight - enough to prepare any warrior for the next battle.
