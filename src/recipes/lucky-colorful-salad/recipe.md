| Baby Lettuce Mix     | 5 oz           | 1      | Vegetable |

| Black Pepper         | 1 teaspoon     | 1      | Spice     |

## Directions

1. Prepare the vegetables: cut the red onion into thin slices, cube the tomatoes, and cut the avocado into bite-sized chunks. As a tip, the avocado is best when slightly under-ripe. [Red Onion: 1/2, Tomatoes: 2, Avocados (under-ripe): 2]
2. Drain the corn. [Corn: 8 oz]
3. Toss together the lettuce, avocado, red onion, tomato, corn, and black pepper. [Lettuce: 5oz, Avocados (sliced): 2, Red Onions (sliced): 1/2, Tomatoes (cubed): 2, Corn: 8 oz]
4. In a separate bowl, juice the limes. Add the extra virgin olive oil and mix thoroughly. [Limes: 2, Extra Virgin Olive Oil: 1 tablespoon]
5. Dress the salad with the lime and enjoy this simple recipe!

## Interpretation

* Deviled Onion: 2
* Sour Avocado: 2
* Lucky Lettuce: 2

Given the simplicity of the ingredients, the rarity of the dish, and the fact this is one of Jin's starting recipes, we believe the Lucky Colorful Salad to be a very simple quick-to-prep salad. Like the Survivalist's Sandwich, this salad is likely made on the trail with whatever's on hand.

We use lime to emulate the sour flavor of Alrest's Sour Avocados. Besides that, we also used tomatoes and corn to add color diversity, giving the salad its name.
