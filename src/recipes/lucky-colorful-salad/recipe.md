## Directions

1. Make the dressing: Combine the avocado, water, olive oil, lime juice, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper in a blender. Blend until creamy. The avocado is best when ripened. [Extra Virgin Olive Oil: 1 tablespoon, Avocado (ripe): 1, Lime Juice: 3 tablespoons, Water: 3/4 cup, Salt: 1/2 teaspoon; Black Pepper: 1/2 teaspoon, Garlic Powder: 1/2 teaspoon]
2. Prepare the vegetables: cut the red onion into thin slices, cube the tomatoes, and drain the corn. [Red Onion: 1/2, Tomatoes: 2, Corn: 8 oz]
3. Toss together the lettuce, red onion, tomato, and corn. [Lettuce: 5 oz, Avocados (sliced): 2, Red Onions (sliced): 1/2, Tomatoes (cubed): 2, Corn: 8 oz]
4. Dress the salad with the avocado dressing from step 1, and enjoy this simple recipe!

## Interpretation

* Deviled Onion: 2
* Sour Avocado: 2
* Lucky Lettuce: 2

Given the simplicity of the ingredients, the rarity of the dish, and the fact this is one of Jin's starting recipes, we believe the Lucky Colorful Salad to be a very simple quick-to-prep salad. Like the Survivalist's Sandwich, this salad is likely made on the trail with whatever's on hand.

We use lime to emulate the sour flavor of Alrest's Sour Avocados. Besides that, we also used tomatoes and corn to add color diversity, giving the salad its name.
