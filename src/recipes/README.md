# Authoring Recipes

To add a recipe:

1. Create a new folder (example: Hyber Meatball Stew -> `hyber-meatball-stew`)
2. Copy the `TEMPLATE.md` file into it, and rename it to `recipe.md`.
3. Fill in everything on the template. **It is important the exact formatting is followed!**
4. Take a representative image and save it into the folder as `main.png`.

As long as the `published` field at the top of the file is `false`, the recipe _won't_ appear on the list of recipes, but _can_ be accessed via direct url so you can preview it. The direct url is `https://monado.recipes/recipes/name-of-folder`.

Once you like the way it looks, we can publish it:

5. Set `published` to `true` in the recipe.md file, and save!

It takes about 5 minutes after commiting the new recipe before it shows up on the website.
