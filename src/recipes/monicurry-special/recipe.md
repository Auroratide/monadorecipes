## Directions

1. Mix the red curry paste with the coriander, cumin, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and cardamom in a bowl until thoroughly blended. Mixture should be very thick. [Red Curry Paste: 6 tablespoons, Coriander: 2 teaspoons, Cumin: 2 teaspoons, Cinnamon: 2 teaspoons, Cloves: 1/2 teaspoon, Nutmeg: 1/4 teaspoon, Cardamom: 1/2 teaspoon]
2. Chop the beef sausage into 1/2 thick coins. Optionally, leave a large section uncut to match the in-game image of the Monicurry Special. [Beef Sausage: 2 pounds]
3. In a medium-sized pot, heat oil over a medium-high heat. Cook beef sausage until they gain color. Remove cooked beef sausage into a different container and set aside. [Oil: 1 tablespoon]
4. Lower heat to medium. Place 1/2 cup of coconut milk in the pot and bring to a boil. Add curry paste and stir well, until the mixture is very thick, after approximately 5 minutes. If mixture thickens too quickly, add a splash of coconut milk or water. [Coconut Milk: 1/2 cup, Mixed Curry Paste: 6 tablespoons]
5. While mixture is thickening, mix together 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and vinegar together. Add optional tomato paste if desired. [Brown Sugar: 2 tablespoons, Lime Juice: 2 tablespoons]
6. Once mixture is thickened, add remaining coconut milk and stir to mix. Add the remaining brown sugar, lime juice mixture, and 2 tablespoons of fish sauce. Bring to a boil. [Coconut Milk: 1 1/2 cups, Brown Sugar: 3 tablespoons, Fish Sauce: 2 tablespoons]
7. Add the beef sausage into the pot and cook partially covered. While this simmers, cook rice according to a rice cooker's instructions. [Rice: 3 cups]
8. Chop carrots and yam into 1-inch cuts/cubes. Cut onions into thin slices, and asparagus into 2-inch segments, throwing away the tough bottoms of the stems. [Carrots: 3, Yam: 1, Onion: 1, Asparagus: 1 cup]
9. Throw in the chopped carrots and asparagus, and simmer for 10 minutes.
10. Throw in the yam and onions, and simmer for 15 minutes while covered with a lid. 
11. Taste sauce for additional seasoning. For saltiness, add fish sauce. Once 15 minutes pass, remove from heat and serve with finished rice.

## Interpretation

* Tasty Sausage: 3
* Pink Asparagus: 1
* Thousand Carrot: 3
* Frangible Yam: 2
* Lucky Spice: 1

We decided that, based on the name and in-game image, Manana's Monicurry special is some form of curry with sausage. When researching curries with sausage, the Thai Massaman curry caught our eye for its ingredient list and deep red color.

Massaman Curry is traditionally made with beef or chicken. Therefore, for the Tasty Sausage, we elected to use beef sausage rather than pork.

Yam for Frangible Yam, asparagus for Pink Asparagus, and carrots for Thousand Carrots are easy additions to the main curry recipe, and the Lucky Spice counts for the rich spice profile of this curry, adding a light but noticeable kick to the dish.
