## Directions

1. Wash the celery stalks before cutting! Chop carrots into one-inch chunks and celery stalks into half-inch chunks. Slice onion into thin slices. [Celery: 2, Carrot: 3, Onion: 1]
2. Heat olive oil in a pot and add the onions, carrots, celery, and a pinch of salt. Cook for 5-7 minutes or until softened. [Olive Oil: 1 tablespoon]
3. While the vegetables cook, slice mushrooms into thin slices. Add mushrooms and a pinch of salt, and cook for another 5 minutes until they release moisture. [Mushrooms: 1 cup]
4. Stir in tomato paste, garlic powder, and paprika. Cook 1-2 minutes until fragrant and the paste darkens slightly. [Tomato Paste: 1 tablespoon, Garlic Powder: 1 teaspoon, Paprika: 1 1/2 teaspoons]
5. Add italian seasoning, bay leaf, vegetable broth, and (optional) crushed tomatoes. Add salt and pepper, mix, and taste the broth for additional seasoning if needed. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes. [Italian Seasoning: 1 teaspoon, Bay Leaf: 1, Vegetable Broth: 6 cups]
6. Poke a carrot and celery piece using a fork to check for readiness. The fork should pierce through, with a little resistance. Taste broth for additional seasoning, if needed. Remove from heat, and serve warm!

## Interpretation

* Comet Carrot: 2
* Kelp Mushroom: 1

The ingredient list for the Chunky Veggie Soup is incredibly simple, with only carrots and mushrooms listed. We decided to add a couple vegetables to make a classic vegetble soup, avoiding potatoes since the original ingredients do not indicate them.

With some celery and onions to add to the soup's main ingredients, and a combination of tomato and paprika to add body and color to the soup, this is a simple but tasty interpretation of a simple recipe!
