## Directions

1. Wash the celery stalks before cutting! Chop carrots into one-inch chunks and celery stalks into half-inch chunks. Slice onion into thin slices. [Ingredient: amount, Ingredient: amount]
2. Heat olive oil in a pot and add the onions, carrots, celery, and a pinch of salt. Cook for 5-7 minutes or until softened.
3. While the vegetables cook, slice mushrooms into thin slices. Add mushrooms and a pinch of salt, and cook for another 5 minutes until they release moisture.
4. Stir in tomato paste, garlic powder, and paprika. Cook 1-2 minutes until fragrant and the paste darkens slightly.
5. Add italian seasoning, bay leaf, vegetable broth, and (optional) crushed tomatoes. Add salt and pepper, mix, and taste the broth for additional seasoning if needed. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes.
6. Poke a carrot and celery piece using a fork to check for readiness. The fork should pierce through, with a little resistance. Taste broth for additional seasoning, if needed. Remove from heat, and serve warm!

## Interpretation

* Comet Carrot: 2
* Kelp Mushroom: 1

The ingredient list for the Chunky Veggie Soup is incredibly simple, with only carrots and mushrooms listed. We decided to add a couple vegetables to make a classic vegetble soup, avoiding potatoes since the original ingredients do not indicate them.

With some celery and onions to add to the soup's main ingredients, and a combination of tomato and paprika to add body and color to the soup, this is a simple but tasty interpretation of a simple recipe!
