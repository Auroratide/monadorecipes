| Seaweed Flakes       | -              | 2      | Vegetable |
| Oil                  | -              | 1      | Oil       |

## Directions

1. Peel off the skin of the Taro Root, then grate it into a bowl. [Taro Root: 6 oz]
2. In a large bowl, mix the flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder. Then, mix in the grated taro and the dashi stock. Set a bowl aside; it is best to allow it to rest for about an hour to let the batter fluff, but it's ok to let it sit for as long as it takes to do Steps 3 and 4. [Flour: 1 cup, Salt: 1/2 teaspoon, Sugar: 1/4 teaspoon, Baking Powder: 1/4 teaspoon, Dashi: 3/4 cup]
3. Mince the green cabbage, discarding the core. Make sure you dry the cabbage well, since it will be going into the batter. [Cabbage: 1/2 heads]
4. Chop the stems off the Bok Choy and set the leaves aside. The stems can either be minced and mixed with the green cabbage, or discarded. [Bok Choy: 1/2 cup]
5. Take the batter bowl. Mix in the Minced Ginger and eggs. Then, add the cabbage into the batter and mix thoroughly. [Minced Ginger: 1 teaspoon, Eggs: 4]
6. Preheat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Once hot, add a scoop of the batter to the pan, and use a spatula to shape it into a thin pancake. If your pan is large enough, you can cook more than one pancake at a time.
7. Place some bok choy leaves on top of each pancake in the pan. Cover the pan and let cook for about 5 minutes. Then, flip each pancake over and let the other side cook, for about 4 minutes.
8. Remove the cooked pancakes and repeat Steps 6 and 7 until all the batter is used.
9. Spread the Okonomi Sauce over each pancake, then sprinkle some seaweed flakes over them and serve! It goes good with rice. Instead of Okonomi Sauce, you may use your favorite ketchup-based sauce, or [make your own okonomi sauce](https://www.justonecookbook.com/okonomiyaki-sauce/) (external link).

## Interpretation

* Amethyst Vanilla: 1
* Ice Cabbage: 5
* Sea Berry: 3
* Puri Leaf Cabbage: 1

Addam's Supercakes is a Tantalese recipe adjusted by Pyra to be unspicy, yet hearty. We found that Japanese Okonomiyaki, essentially cabbage pancakes, fits Xenoblade's ingredient list very well.

Normally, okonomiyaki is made with Japanese yam instead of taro, and pork belly instead of bok choy. Taro, also a kind of yam, represents the Amethyst Vanilla for its purple tint and vanilla hint. Since the Xenoblade recipe called for two types of cabbage, we decided to use the Puri Leaf Cabbage (the Bok Choy) as an alternative topping.

Finally, the seaweed topping represents the Sea Berry. In the game, Sea Berries are a flower collectible, not an actual fruit like the name suggests. So, perhaps the green part of Tantal's sea berries is what's edible for cooking, and what better sea-based green to top this dish than seaweed?
