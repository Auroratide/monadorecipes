## Directions

1. Prepare the vegetables. Slice the cucumbers into long, thin straws and the mushrooms into thin slices. For the bok choy, separate the stems from the leaves, and set the leaves aside for later. [Persian Cucumbers: 2, Shiitake Mushrooms: 8 oz, Baby Bok Choy: 2]
2. Heat the vegetable oil over medium heat in a pot. Add the garlic, cucumber slices, mushroom slices, and bok choy stems to the pot and saute for about 5 minutes. [Vegetable Oil: 1 tablespoon, Garlic: 3 cloves]
3. Add the soy sauce, vegetable broth, water, and sesame oil. Increase the heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Add the dashi as well. [Soy Sauce: 1/4 cup, Vegetable Broth: 4 cups, Water: 1 cup, Sesame Oil: 2 tablespoons, Dashi: 1 tablespoon]
4. Add the frozen dumplings to the pot, and let boil for 5-10 minutes (follow the recommendation of the packaging). [Frozen Seafood Dumplings: 1 1/2 pounds]
5. Reduce the heat, and add the leaves of the baby bok choy and green onions.
6. Serve hot!

## Interpretation

* Ruska Flour: 2
* Tornan Trout: 1
* Sumpkin: 1

Given the recipe's rarity and simple ingredients, we went with a simple Japanese-styled dumpling soup: vegetables, dumplings, and a tasty broth all brought to a boil. That said, there are two interesting substitutions.

First, for the Tornan Trout we use _seafood_ dumplings. Dumplings normally contain pork and/or vegetables, and using seafood dumplings instead gives this soup a unique flavor. And second, for the Sumkin we use cucumbers, which in our recipe is replacing what would normally be carrots.
