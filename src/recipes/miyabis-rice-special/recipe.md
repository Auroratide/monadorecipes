## Ingredients

| -------------------- | -------------- | ------ | --------- |
| Salmon (with skin)   | 4 fillets      | 2      | Fish      |
| Soy Sauce            | 1/3 cup        | 1      | Liquid    |
| Honey                | 1 tablespoon   | 2      | Liquid    |
| Sesame Oil           | 1 tablespoon   | 2      | Oil       |
| Garlic (minced)      | 2 teaspoons    | 1      | Vegetable |
| Ginger (minced)      | 1 teaspoon     | 1      | Vegetable |
| Radish (sliced)      | 1/2 cup        | 1      | Vegetable |
| Rice                 | 2 cups         | 1      | Grain     |

## Directions

1. Start cooking the rice. [Rice: 2 cups]
2. In a medium bowl, mix together the soy sauce, honey, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger. Put the salmon and half of the marinade mixture into a plastic bag and marinate for at least 15 minutes. [Salmon: 4 fillets, Soy Sauce: 1/3 cup, Honey: 1 tablespoon, Sesame Oil: 1 tablespoon, Garlic (minced): 2 teaspoons, Ginger (minced): 1 teaspoon]
3. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375°F (191°C) and prepare a large rectangular pan with parchment paper.
4. Cut the radishes into thin slices. [Radish: 1/2 cup]
5. After marination, place the salmon and radishes into the pan, saving the remaining marinade. Bake the salmon for 15-20 minutes.
6. While the salmon bakes, pour the unused marinade and the used marinade from Step 5 into a saucepan, and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 4 minutes until slightly thickened. Then, remove from heat.
7. Spread the glaze onto the salmon and radishes, and serve with rice. This also goes good with miso soup!

## Interpretation

* Smushi Rice: 3
* Glitter Radish: 2
* Refreshing Piranhax Meat: 1
* Soyprimo Sauce: 2

During the cooking contest in Miyabi’s ascension quest, she prepared a simple yet reliable dish: fish glazed in a special soyprimo sauce and served with rice. For our interpretation, we chose baked salmon finished with a glaze of soy, honey, and garlic.

In the quest, the piranhax appears as a red fish with the skin left on, so salmon felt like the closest real-world counterpart. Soy sauce, honey, and garlic form a classic combination for a salmon glaze, which fits nicely with soyprimo being a treasured household recipe in Xenoblade. Finally, we include radishes—just as shown in the quest—to provide a bit of extra texture.
