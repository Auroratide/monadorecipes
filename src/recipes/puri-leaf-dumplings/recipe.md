| Cabbage (diced)      | 1/4 cup        | 1      | Vegetable |
| Mayonnaise           | 2 tablespoons  | 1      | Liquid    |
| Salt                 | -              | 1      | Spice     |

## Directions

1. Begin cooking the rice. It's good to use just over 3 cups of water. [Short Grain Rice: 3 cups]
2. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Prep the flounder in a pan and salt it. Cover the pan and bake the fish for 25 minutes. [Flounder (fillet): 1, Salt: -]
3. Once the flounder is done, flake it into small pieces. Mix the flounder, mayonnaise, diced cabbage together in a bowl. Add some salt to taste. [Flounder: 1 fillet, Mayonnaise: 2 tablespoons, Cabbage (diced): 1/4 cup]
4. Once the rice is done, let it cool for a bit, but keep it moist with a wet paper towel. Thoroughly mix the rice with as much rice seasoning as you want. [Rice: 3 cups, Rice Seasoning: -]
5. To make one rice ball, wet your hands with cold water and scoop out a small handful of rice. Place some of the flounder filling into the center, and form the rice around it. Cup your hands to form it into a classic rounded triangle, and finally wrap it with one piece of seaweed. [Seaweed: 0.2 ounces]
6. Repeat Step 5 until you are out of rice or filling. These dumplings go great with soy sauce! If you had spare fish fillets, it also goes great with baked fish!

## Interpretation

* Salty Soil: 1
* Gromrice: 4
* Flying Flounder: 2
* Puri Leaf Cabbage: 2

We know from the quest <i>Tranquility</i> that Vess's "dumplings" are traditional Japanese rice balls, onigiri. The ingredients match this two with a heavy emphasis on gromrice and salt.

Onigiri can be filled in many ways. Salmon and tuna are popular filling choices, but since Vess's recipe uses Flying Flounder, we opted to use flounder too. Using regular cabbage for the Puri Leaf Cabbage and mayonnaise to blend it with the flounder gives the onigiri a splendid crunch.
