## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C), and prepare a 7 &times; 11 &times; 2 inch pan.
2. Skin and thinnly slice the potatoes, about ⅛ inches thick (3 mm). [Potatoes: 2.5 pounds]
3. Thinnly cut the zucchini, about ⅛ inches thick (3 mm), and quarter the slices into wedges. [Zucchini: 1]
4. Mince the carrots into very small pieces. [Carrots: 2]
5. Mix together the butter, heavy cream, minced garlic, salt, pepper, thyme, and red pepper flakes. [Butter (melted): 2 tablespoons, Heavy Cream: 1 1/2 cups, Garlic (minced): 2 cloves, Salt: 1 teaspoon, Pepper: 1/2 teaspoon, Thyme: 1/2 teaspoon, Red Pepper Flakes: 1 teaspoon]
6. **Layer 1**: Spread ⅓ of the potatoes, zucchini, and carrots into the pan. Pour ⅓ of the cream mixture over the potaoes. Sprinkle ⅓ of each of the cheeses over the layer. If you are including scallops, layer all of them here together with the potatoes. [Swiss Cheese: 1/3 cup, Mild Cheddar Cheese: 1/3 cup]

## Interpretation

* Meaty Carrot: 1
* Sumpkin: 3
* Glitterspud: 2
* Hot Orange: 5
* Oil Oyster: 1

Since many of Pyra's dishes are French or Italian inspired, we went with a variation of Potatoes au Gratin (Dauphinoise), a French recipe for baking potatoes in cream.

The recipe's name "Glitterbake" implies the main ingredient is the glitterspud, in our world called the potato. The French recipe stops there, but this where Pyra's personal touch begins. She uses different vegetables to add color (_glitter_, if you will) to the dish. In our interpretation, Meaty Carrots are orange carrots, Sumpkins are green zucchinis (a kind of squash), and Hot Oranges are the red pepper flakes.

Finally, we included scallops as the Oil Oysters in the recipe, since scallops are a kind of mollusk, and scallops go well with creamy recipes like au gratin. As the original au gratin recipe includes no seafood, we'd like to think that the inclusion of Oil Oyster was inspired by Argentum culture.
