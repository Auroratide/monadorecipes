## Interpretation

* Feris Beastmeat: 2
* Sour Avocado: 1
* Barbed Tomato: 1
* Confusion Ivy: 1
* Lucky Lettuce: 2

This stew is a simple, albeit famous, comfort food invented by an innkeeper in the small village of Hyber. The recipe focuses on the simplicity: preparation is cutting vegetables, and cooking is just simmering over heat.

What makes Hyber's stew famous is its use of avocado. Avocado is not an ingredient that is normally cooked, but when used as a topping, it adds a smooth creaminess to an otherwise thick stew. The use of lime adds the "sour" to Aletta's sour avocados, and it actually works quite well.

Finally, this recipe uses tomato as the soup's base, cabbage as lucky lettuce (as actual lettuce wilts in heat), and parsley as confusion ivy.
