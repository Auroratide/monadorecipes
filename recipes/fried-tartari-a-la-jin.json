In the Great Tornan Cook-Off, Jin can cook either the Fried Tartari or the Wingberry Cake, and either will show the final result of the recipe. That's the primary reason we chose a salisbury steak to represent the tartari: ground meat fried to perfection and dowsed in gravy.</p><p>The meat is a mixture of beef (beastmeat), poultry (birdmeat), and ketchup (barbed tomato), pan-fried as the recipe name suggests. The flour thickens the roux that eventually becomes the gravy atop the steak, giving it that classic salisbury look and taste.</p><p>Finally, we generally interpret Nest Extract to be honey, since they are collected from the nests of Alrest's bee-like creatures. Honey does not blend naturally with a mushroom-based gravy, so since the reference image includes some side vegetables, we used the honey to roast carrots and potatoes on the side.</p>","references":["https://www.recipetineats.com/salisbury-steak-with-mushroom-gravy/","https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/honey-glazed-roasted-root-vegetables"]}
