The French recipe stops there, but this where Pyra's personal touch begins. She uses different vegetables to add color (<em>glitter</em>, if you will) to the dish. In our interpretation, Meaty Carrots are orange carrots, Sumpkins are green zucchinis (a kind of squash), and Hot Oranges are the red pepper flakes.</p><p>Finally, we included scallops as the Oil Oysters in the recipe, since scallops are a kind of mollusk, and scallops go well with creamy recipes like au gratin. As the original au gratin recipe includes no seafood, we'd like to think that the inclusion of Oil Oyster was inspired by Argentum culture.</p>","references":["https://www.recipetineats.com/potatoes-au-gratin/"]}
