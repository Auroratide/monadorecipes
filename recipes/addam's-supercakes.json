We found that Japanese Okonomiyaki, essentially cabbage pancakes, fits Xenoblade's ingredient list very well.</p><p>Normally, okonomiyaki is made with Japanese yam instead of taro, and pork belly instead of bok choy. Taro, also a kind of yam, represents the Amethyst Vanilla for its purple tint and vanilla hint. Since the Xenoblade recipe called for two types of cabbage, we decided to use the Puri Leaf Cabbage (the Bok Choy) as an alternative topping.</p><p>Finally, the seaweed topping represents the Sea Berry. In the game, Sea Berries are a flower collectible, not an actual fruit like the name suggests. So, perhaps the green part of Tantal's sea berries is what's edible for cooking, and what better sea-based green to top this dish than seaweed?</p>","references":["https://www.justonecookbook.com/okonomiyaki/"]}
