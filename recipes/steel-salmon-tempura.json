Thus, we decided on the simple but effective route for Aegaeon's dish - a fish and carrot tempura, with rice and soy sauce for flavor. Salmon, tilapia, and even carrots are common ingredients in tempura, lining up with the Steel Salmon, Windyfish, and Meaty Carrot in the original recipe.</p><p>We opted for a pre-made tempura batter mix for simplicity, though it is simple enough to create your own batter from raw ingredients. Lastly, adding a little seasoning to the batter adds a slightly unique flavor profile to the tempura, characterized by the Angel's Sage in the original recipe. While rice and the dipping soy sauce are not implied in Aegaeon's recipe, we felt it would round out the plate for a full meal.</p>","references":["https://www.justonecookbook.com/tempura-recipe/"]}
