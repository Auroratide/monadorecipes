This aligns with the ingredients list somewhat - chowders commonly include an array of vegetables and a protein. Though radishes are not a common ingredient in chowders, we felt they would pair well with potatoes and carrots in this recipe.</p><p>For the Bunnit Meat, we opted for chicken. Bunnits appear like rabbits in the game, and rabbit meat has been likened to chicken meat. All together, the Glitter Radish and Comet Carrots make up parts of the chowder, and we chose potatoes to be the vegetable that appears like stars in the soup itself. This dish comes out to be a creamy and hearty delight - enough to prepare any warrior for the next battle.</p>","references":["https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/232546/easy-chicken-and-corn-chowder/"]}
