The main difference is the inclusion of red peppers, giving the variant Crossette's characteristic spicy kick.</p><p>We let the pazza stew for longer so the spice from the peppers can diffuse into the sauce. As an added benefit, the tomato's flavor also gets enhanced, which is perhaps a subtle improvement over Pyra's pazza.
