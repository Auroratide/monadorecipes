Due to the large amounts of flour in the recipe, we interpret this as a kind of upside-down coffee cake.</p>\n\t\t<p>Cranberry Bells imply that cranberries are the fruit of choice. As for the nut, we chose almonds since almonds sometimes used as a milk alternative; in other words, a \"Lactonut\" is a milky nut.</p>\n\t\t<p>Finally, many coffee cake recipes ask for either vanilla extract or cinnamon. For this recipe, we substitute those with honey since Jin's recipe calls for Melosian Honey.</p>\n\t"}
