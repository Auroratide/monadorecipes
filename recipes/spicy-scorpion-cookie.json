Since the recipe contains Lactonuts, we based Mythra's experiment on macadamia nut cookies.</p><p>For the spice, we use cayenne pepper, which is a ground form of red pepper. For the barbed tomato, we used tomato paste, giving the cookie a nice reddish hue. We tried other forms of tomato, but due to their water content would always make the cookies overly cakey.</p><p>As for the scorpion? You can't generally buy scorpions or bugs, so instead we simulate it with chia seeds! The seeds act like flakes of the scorpions' exoskeletons, giving the cookies a unique look and... unsettling crunch.</p>","references":["https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/10025/white-chocolate-macadamia-nut-cookies-iii/"]}
