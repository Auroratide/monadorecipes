For our interpretation, we chose baked salmon finished with a glaze of soy, honey, and garlic.</p><p>In the quest, the piranhax appears as a red fish with the skin left on, so salmon felt like the closest real-world counterpart. Soy sauce, honey, and garlic form a classic combination for a salmon glaze, which fits nicely with soyprimo being a treasured household recipe in Xenoblade. Finally, we include radishes—just as shown in the quest—to provide a bit of extra texture.</p>","references":[{"name":"Glazed Salmon by Sally's Baking","href":"https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/honey-garlic-salmon/"}]}
