The recipe focuses on the simplicity: preparation is cutting vegetables, and cooking is just simmering over heat.</p><p>What makes Hyber's stew famous is its use of avocado. Avocado is not an ingredient that is normally cooked, but when used as a topping, it adds a smooth creaminess to an otherwise thick stew. The use of lime adds the &quot;sour&quot; to Aletta's sour avocados, and it actually works quite well.</p><p>Finally, this recipe uses tomato as the soup's base, cabbage as lucky lettuce (as actual lettuce wilts in heat), and parsley as confusion ivy.</p>"}
