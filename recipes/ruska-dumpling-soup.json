That said, there are two interesting substitutions.</p><p>First, for the Tornan Trout we use <em>seafood</em> dumplings. Dumplings normally contain pork and/or vegetables, and using seafood dumplings instead gives this soup a unique flavor. And second, for the Sumkin we use cucumbers, which in our recipe is replacing what would normally be carrots.</p>","references":["https://soupaddict.com/potsticker-soup/"]}
