Firm, white fish cooked with small, juicy tomatoes is a common theme among recipes, and this fits well with Pyra's use of Emblazoned Ray and Whisper Tomatoes.</p><p>Where this recipe differs from most is in the use of Bok Choy cabbage instead of fennel, in order to represent the Puri Leaf Cabbage. Bok Choy's stem provides a similar texture, albeit with a milder flavor.</p><p>We use red pepper flakes to represent the Spirit Clematis, as clematis plants may have been used in the past as a pepper substitute prior to the discovery of its toxicity. Finally, to emphasize the &quot;Pearl&quot; part of the dish's name, whole olives are used to give a pearl-like appearance.</p>","references":["https://www.ciaoitalia.com/recipes/acqua-pazza-2"]}
